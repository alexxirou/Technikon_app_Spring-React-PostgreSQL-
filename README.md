# Technikon Project

Welcome to the Technikon project repository! This project is a full-stack web application designed to streamline property repair/renovation processes for both managers and customers.

## Description

The Technikon project leverages modern web technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution for property repair/renovation management. It utilizes Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database, offering a seamless user experience and efficient data management.


## Features
## Key Features

- **Spring Boot Backend**: The backend of the Technikon project is built using Spring Boot, a powerful framework for building Java-based applications. Spring Boot provides a lightweight and efficient platform for developing RESTful APIs, managing data persistence, and implementing business logic.

- **React Frontend**: The frontend of the Technikon project is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and declarative programming model enable the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: The Technikon project utilizes PostgreSQL, a robust and feature-rich relational database management system, for storing and managing project data. PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance, extensibility, and support for complex queries, making it suitable for managing large volumes of data in a multi-user environment.

- **RESTful APIs**: The backend of the Technikon project exposes RESTful APIs that allow the frontend to communicate with the server. These APIs enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on project data, facilitating seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The Technikon project implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to project data. It utilizes industry-standard authentication protocols such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.
